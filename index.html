</p>
<p>
    Module 01 Modeling Building Elements
</p>
<p>
    This module serves as a good introduction to the concepts of host elements
    such as walls and wall hosted elements such as doors and windows. With
    these key underpinnings you should feel confident in developing your own
    BIM models applying these concepts.

<p>
    <a name="Exercise1A">Exercise 1 — Modeling Exterior and Interior Walls</a>
</p>
<p>
    In this exercise, you will complete the development of both exterior and
    interior walls using a DWG underlay as a guide.
</p>
<p>
    Objectives:
</p>
<p>
    · Create walls by picking their location line and sketching them in a plan
    view.
</p>
<p>
    · Change the orientation of walls that have been placed.

    <em>
        Note: Placement of walls is direction dependent relative to the
        location line used. If wall footprint falls outside of the intended
        location, use the space bar key to flip the orientation of the wall
        while drawing.

    <a name="Exercise1C">Exercise 3 — Creating Floors and Roofs</a>
</p>
<p>
    In this exercise, you will create flat roofs and pitched roofs for the
    house used in the previous exercise using Autodesk Revit.
</p>
<p>
    Objectives:
</p>
<p>
    · Create roofs based on the building footprint.
</p>
<p>
    · Sketch a roof boundary and selecting the slope-defining edges.
</p>
<p>
    · Set the roof level and slope instance properties.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>

<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Create a flat roof
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Navigate to the folder containing the downloaded resources for Module 1.
</p>
<p>
    Module01_Resources
</p>
<p>
    2. Open Revit file: Module01Ex03_Creating Roofs_Imperial_Start.rvt
</p>
<p>
    3. Open the Workspace Roof plan view.
</p>
<p>
    4. On the Architecture tab, click Roof by Footprint.
</p>
<p>
    5. In Properties Palette, select Basic Roof Generic - 12” roof type and set
    Base Offset from Level = <strong>0’-0” (0m)</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    6. In Modify | Create Roof Footprint tab, confirm Boundary Line and Line
    mode is selected.
</p>
<p>
    a. Unmark Defines slope check box.
</p>
<p>
    7. Create a closed boundary as indicated by the (4) sketch lines numbered
    below. The sketch lines should be placed on the inside face of walls.
</p>
<p>
    a. Click Modify command to end sketching.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Note: Linework must be contiguous.</em>
</p>
<p>
    8. Click Finish Edit Mode to create the 3D roof element.
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Note: If you receive error messages, confirm that none of the linework
        overlaps itself. Then try Finish Edit mode again.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    9. Open the Carport Roof plan view.
</p>
<p>
    10. Create the other flat roof using the same technique in steps 4 through
    8.
</p>
<p>
    11. Hit Modify to end creating roofs.
</p>
<p>
    12. Select highlighted wall shown below.
</p>
<p>
    a. Click Attach Top / Base
</p>
<p>
    b. Click edge of Flat roof just created
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    1. Open the Living Area Roof plan view.
</p>
<p>
    2. On the Architecture tab, click Roof by Footprint.
</p>
<p>
    3. In Properties Palette, select Basic Roof Generic - 12” roof type and set
    Base Offset from Level = <strong>0’-0” (0m)</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    4. In Modify | Create Roof Footprint tab, confirm Boundary Line and Line
    mode is selected.
</p>
<p>
    a. Mark Defines slope check box.
</p>
<p>
    5. Create a closed boundary as indicated by the (10) sketch lines numbered
    below. Trace over the red linework in the view.
</p>
<p>
    a. Click Modify command to end sketching.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Note: Linework must be contiguous.</em>
</p>
<p>
    6. Set the roof pitch for the sloped linework.
