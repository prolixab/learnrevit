# Views and Visualization

In this module, you explore the tools available in the Autodesk® Revit®
software to create several types of common project views and specify the
information that appears in them.

You will be able to:

-   Create 2D views of their building model, such as plans, elevations,
    and sections---creating new views from scratch and duplicating
    existing views.

-   Create 3D views by duplicating and editing the default 3D
    orthographic view.

-   Customize the information presented in those views.

[Exercise 1 Creating Plan Views](exercise1)

[Exercise 2 Creating Elevation and Section Views](exercise2)

[Exercise 3 Creating 3D Views](exercise3)

[Exercise 4 Adjusting the Appearance of Elements in a View](exercise4)
