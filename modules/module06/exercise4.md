## Exercise 4 --- Adjusting the Appearance of Elements in a View  

**In this exercise, you will create an exterior perspective view and duplicate the view to apply different visual styles for presentation. In addition you will be introduced to some of the properties in Graphic Display Options.**

Objectives:

-   Use the View Control bar to quickly change a views display
    propertiesâ€•for example, the level of detail and the visual style.

-   Display shadows and specifying the location of the lighting source.

-   Set a project's location and orientation to cast accurate shadows in
    a solar study.

-   Use Graphic Display Options to enhance the silhouettes of elements
    and add gradient backgrounds to 3D views..

### Create an exterior perspective view using the Camera tool
