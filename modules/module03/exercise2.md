## Exercise 2 --- Adjusting Grid Lines

In this exercise, you will explore designing a creative curtain grid
layout for the same house used in the previous exercise using Autodesk
Revit.

Objectives:

-   Add new grids to existing curtain walls.

-   Edit existing curtain grid lines and segments.

-   Add mullions to curtain grid lines.

-   Pin and unpin curtain system elements to prevent or allow changes to
    the layout.
