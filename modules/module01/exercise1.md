## Modeling Exterior and Interior Walls

**In this exercise, you will complete the development of both exterior and
interior walls using an underlay as a guide. Note that the underlay serves only as a rough guide - exactness is not expected.**

Objectives:

-   Create walls by picking their location line and sketching them in a
    plan view.

-   Change the orientation of walls that have been placed.


### Create exterior walls

1.   **Download the start file [here](Module01Ex01.rvt).**

2.  Open the file.

3.  Open the Ground Floor plan view.

4.  On the Architecture tab, click Wall.

5.  In Properties Palette, select Generic 8\" (.20 m) wall type. Place
    the walls by setting the location line to Finish Face:Exterior and
    tracing the outer edge of the walls shown in the underlay drawing.

    *Note: Placement of walls is direction dependent relative to the
    location line used. If wall footprint falls outside of the intended
    location, use the space bar key to flip the orientation of the wall
    while drawing.*

6.  Completion of exterior walls highlighted in blue.

### Create interior walls

1.  Continue adding interior walls to the building model using the underlay drawing as a guide to determine
    their location.

2.  Add new interior walls using the Generic 3\" (.08 m) wall type.
    Place the walls by setting the location line to either the Finish Face:Exterior or
    Finish Face:Interior and tracing the corresponding edge of the walls shown
    in the underlay drawing.

    *Note: Placement of walls is direction dependent relative to the
    location line used. If wall footprint falls outside of the intended
    location, use the space bar key to flip the orientation of the wall
    while drawing.*


7.  Completion of interior walls highlighted in blue.

1.  Save the Revit file as: Module01Ex01_Finished.rvt and hand in.

    This concludes Exercise 1.
