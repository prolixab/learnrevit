# Modeling Building Elements

## Exercise 1 --- Modeling Exterior and Interior Walls

**In this exercise, you will complete the development of both exterior and
interior walls using a DWG underlay as a guide.**

Objectives:

-   Create walls by picking their location line and sketching them in a
    plan view.

-   Change the orientation of walls that have been placed.
 

Create exterior walls

1.  Navigate to the folder containing the downloaded resources for
    Module 1.

Module01_Resources

2.  Open Revit file: Module01Ex01_Modeling Exterior and Interior
    Walls_Imperial_Start.rvt

3.  Open the Ground Floor plan view.

4.  On the Architecture tab, click Wall.

5.  In Properties Palette, select Generic 8\" (.20 m) wall type. Place
    the walls by setting the location line to Finish Face:Exterior and
    tracing the outer edge of the walls shown in the underlay drawing.

    *Note: Placement of walls is direction dependent relative to the
    location line used. If wall footprint falls outside of the intended
    location, use the space bar key to flip the orientation of the wall
    while drawing.*

6.  Completion of exterior walls highlighted in blue.

Create interior walls

1.  Continue adding interior walls to the building model shown in the
    video tutorial, using the underlay drawing as a guide to determine
    their location.

2.  Add new interior walls using the Generic 3\" (.08 m) wall type.
    Place the walls

    by setting the location line to either the Finish Face:Exterior or
    Finish

    Face:Interior and tracing the corresponding edge of the walls shown
    in the underlay drawing.

    *Note: Placement of walls is direction dependent relative to the
    location line used. If wall footprint falls outside of the intended
    location, use the space bar key to flip the orientation of the wall
    while drawing.*


7.  Completion of interior walls highlighted in blue.

1.  Save the Revit file as: Module01Ex01_Modeling Exterior and Interior
    Walls_Imperial_Finished.rvt

    This concludes Exercise 1.
