## Creating Floors and Roofs


**In this exercise, you will create flat roofs and pitched roofs for the
house used in the previous exercise using Autodesk Revit.**

Objectives:

-   Create roofs based on the building footprint.

-   Sketch a roof boundary and selecting the slope-defining edges.

-   Set the roof level and slope instance properties.

## Create a flat roof

1.   **Download the start file [here](Module01Ex03.rvt).**

28. Open the Workspace Roof plan view.

29. In Properties Palette, select Basic Roof Generic - 12" roof type and
    set Base Offset from Level = **0'-0" (0m)**.

30. In Modify \| Create Roof Footprint tab, confirm Boundary Line and
    Line mode is selected.

31. Create a closed boundary as indicated by the (4) sketch lines
    numbered below. The sketch lines should be placed on the inside face
    of walls.

    a.  Click Modify command to end sketching.

        *Note: Linework must be contiguous.*

32. Click Finish Edit Mode to create the 3D roof element.

    *Note: If you receive error messages, confirm that none of the
    linework overlaps itself. Then try Finish Edit mode again.*

33. Open the Carport Roof plan view.

34. Create the other flat roof using the same technique in steps 4
    through 8.

35. Hit Modify to end creating roofs.

36. Select highlighted wall shown below.

    a.  Click Attach Top / Base

## Create a pitched roof

1.  Open the Living Area Roof plan view.


3.  On the Architecture tab, click Roof by Footprint.

    ![](media\image17.png)


37. In Properties Palette, select Basic Roof Generic - 12" roof type and
    set Base Offset from Level = **0'-0" (0m)**.

    ![](media\image26.png)

38. In Modify \| Create Roof Footprint tab, confirm Boundary Line and
    Line mode is selected.

    ![](media\image19.png)

    a.  Mark Defines slope check box.

    ![](media\image27.png)

39. Create a closed boundary as indicated by the (10) sketch lines
    numbered below. Trace over the red linework in the view.

    ![](media\image28.png)

    a.  Click Modify command to end sketching.

        *Note: Linework must be contiguous.*

40. Set the roof pitch for the sloped linework.

    a.  Window select all of the sketch linework for the roof sketch.

    ![](media\image29.png)

    b.  In Properties palette, set pitch to **3" (0.0762m)**.

    ![](media\image30.png)

41. Click Finish Edit Mode to create the 3D roof element.

    ![](media\image22.png)

    *Note: If you receive error messages, confirm that none of the
    linework overlaps itself. Then try Finish Edit mode again.*

    a.  Attach highlighted walls to roof? Click Yes.
