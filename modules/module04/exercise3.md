## Exercise 3 --- Creating a Floor Opening

** In this exercise, you will create a floor opening for the spiral stair
created in the previous exercise and add protective railing. **

Objectives:

-   Cut an opening to allow stairs to pass through floors.

-   Calculate the head height of stairways.

-   Modify floor openings.

-   Create railings.

-   Modify the physical properties of railings.

Create floor opening

1.  Navigate to the folder containing the downloaded resources for
    Module 4.

Module04_Resources

21. Open Revit file: Module04Ex03_Creating Floor
    Opening_Imperial_Start.rvt

22. Open the Second Floor plan view.

    a.  Starting spiral stair layout.

        height="1.3263888888888888in"}

    b.  Finished spiral stair layout.

        ![](media\image39.png){width="1.5167508748906386in"
        height="1.3125in"}

23. Select the second floor plate.

    a.  Create a crossing-window selection set starting just outside the
        > East wall and dragging inwards into the building.

    b.  Click the Filter tool to isolate the Floors category.

24. Edit floor boundary.

    a.  On Modify \| Floors tab, Mode panel, click Edit Boundary.

        ![](media\image40.png){width="1.86in" height="0.72in"}

    b.  Using the Line tool from the Draw panel, sketch out lines
        > indicated by Mark 1 and Mark 2 below.

        ![](media\image41.png){width="1.6625349956255469in"
        height="1.6493821084864393in"}

    c.  Switch to Center-ends Arc tool and draw an arc with a **3' --
        > 10" (1.16m)** radius starting from the North side and ending
        > at 180 degrees. Refer to picture above.

    d.  Hit ESC key once to end the sketch mode.

    e.  Select the Arc line and drag the endpoint clockwise to the 270
        > degree angle. Use the trim tool to clean up the linework as
        > needed.

        ![](media\image42.png){width="1.6111111111111112in"
        height="1.4312040682414697in"}

    f.  Click the Finish Edit Mode to generate the floor opening.

        ![](media\image43.png){width="1.82in" height="0.74in"}

    g.  If you receive a warning message, click Unjoin elements.

    h.  Finished floor opening result below.

        ![](media\image44.png){width="1.6388888888888888in"
        height="1.4779505686789152in"}

Add railing to floor opening

1.  On the Architectural tab, Circulation panel, from the Railing tool
    pulldown menu, click Sketch Path.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
25. Draw linear railing.

    a.  Use the Line tool to sketch the horizontal line from the column
        > to the edge of the wall indicated by Mark 1.

        ![](media\image45.png){width="1.6388888888888888in"
        height="1.5020866141732283in"}

    b.  Click Finish Edit Mode to generate the first railing element.

        ![](media\image46.png){width="1.24in" height="0.8in"}

        *Note: Railing sketches must be contiguous. The circular railing
        will be created separately.*

26. Draw curvilinear railing.

    a.  Use the Center-ends Arc tool to sketch a curvilinear line
        > tracing the floor opening starting at the top of the stairs
        > and dragging the arc clockwise to the 180 degree position.

        ![](media\image47.png){width="1.6319444444444444in"
        height="1.4983978565179352in"}

    b.  Hit ESC key twice, then select the arc line and drag the end
        > point from 180 degrees to 270 degrees.

    c.  Click Finish Edit Mode to generate the first railing element.

        ![](media\image46.png){width="1.24in" height="0.8in"}

    d.  Open Second Floor -- Spiral Stair 3D View to see the finished
        > railing result below.

        ![](media\image48.png){width="2.0453018372703413in"
        height="1.4722222222222223in"}

27. Save the Revit file as: Module04Ex03_Creating Floor
    Opening_Imperial_Finished.rvt

    This concludes Exercise 3.
