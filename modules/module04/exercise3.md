## Exercise 3 --- Creating a Floor Opening

**In this exercise, you will create a floor opening for the spiral stair created in the previous exercise and add protective railing.**

Objectives:

-   Cut an opening to allow stairs to pass through floors.

-   Calculate the head height of stairways.

-   Modify floor openings.

-   Create railings.

-   Modify the physical properties of railings.

### Create floor opening

1.   **Download the start file [here](Module04Ex03.rvt).**

22. Open the Second Floor plan view.

    a.  Starting spiral stair layout.

    c.  Switch to Center-ends Arc tool and draw an arc with a **1.16m** radius starting from the North side and ending at 180 degrees. Refer to picture above.

    d.  Hit ESC key once to end the sketch mode.

    e.  Select the Arc line and drag the endpoint clockwise to the 270 degree angle. Use the trim tool to clean up the linework as needed.

### Add railing to floor opening

1.  On the Architectural tab, Circulation panel, from the Railing tool
    pulldown menu, click Sketch Path.


25. Draw linear railing.

    a.  Use the Line tool to sketch the horizontal line from the column to the edge of the wall indicated by Mark 1.

    *Note: Railing sketches must be contiguous. The circular railing will be created separately.*

26. Draw curvilinear railing.

    a.  Use the Center-ends Arc tool to sketch a curvilinear line tracing the floor opening starting at the top of the stairs and dragging the arc clockwise to the 180 degree position.

    ![](media\image47.png)

    b.  Hit ESC key twice, then select the arc line and drag the end point from 180 degrees to 270 degrees.

    c.  Click Finish Edit Mode to generate the first railing element.
